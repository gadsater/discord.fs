# discord.fs
A virtual filesystem encrypted with AES and metadata hashed with MD5 on discord servers via messages. It's literally free real-estate.

## Details
discord.fs can take files, compress them, then encrypt them (discord devs can't snoop your files, or anyone for that matter!), and store it as messages using base85 for optimal storage. The technology utilized to secure your files leaks no information; the owner of the file, the file name, or the data itself. It's safe, and free.
